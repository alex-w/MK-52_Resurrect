* Instant on - calculator remembers the prior state and does not reset itself upon power-up.
* Cx button cleared the entire input to zero. Now in Edit mode it works as a backspace.
* Decimal did not start the data entry. Now it works as an entry button, making "0." input.
* Exponent. Now it works as an entry button, making "1.0E+000" input if X=0.
* Number range is from about -1E-300 to +1E+300 instead of +/-9.9999999E+99.
* Numbers between 0.1 and 1 are not "exponetized".
* Whole numbers are preserved whole until the operation necessary converts them into real.
* Unnecessary zeros are truncated for X between 0.1 and 99999999999.9.
* Can delete/insert a program line with automatic recompute of GOTOs, GOSUBs, IFs and LOOPs.
